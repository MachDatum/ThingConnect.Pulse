### Status Cards

The top of the dashboard displays key metrics:

- **Total Endpoints**: Number of configured monitoring targets
- **Online Count**: Endpoints currently responding
- **Offline Count**: Endpoints currently not responding  
- **Average Response Time**: Network performance indicator

### Real-Time Monitoring Grid

The main grid shows all endpoints with:

- **Endpoint Name**: Friendly name for each monitoring target
- **Status**: Current availability (Online, Offline, Warning)
- **Response Time**: Latest latency measurement
- **Uptime %**: Availability percentage over selected timeframe
- **Last Check**: Timestamp of most recent test

### Alert Panel

Recent alerts and notifications are displayed in the right panel:

- **Active Alerts**: Currently triggered notifications
- **Recent Events**: Historical alert activity
- **Alert Trends**: Patterns in your alert frequency

## Filtering and Views

### Status Filters

Filter the endpoint grid by status:

- **All**: Show all endpoints regardless of status
- **Online**: Display only responsive endpoints
- **Offline**: Show only failed endpoints
- **Warning**: Display endpoints with performance issues

### Grouping Options

Organize endpoints for better visibility:

- **By Type**: Group ICMP, TCP, and HTTP endpoints
- **By Location**: Organize by physical or logical location
- **By Priority**: Group by business criticality
