# LinkedIn Strategy (Minimal Approach)

Build ThingConnect brand awareness among manufacturing IT/OT professionals with minimal time investment (4-6 hours/week total).

## Content Schedule: 2 Posts Per Week

### **Monday: "Manufacturing Monday" - Industry Insight** (30 minutes)
**Format**: Long-form post (1,200-1,500 characters)

**Template**:

[Industry statistic or trend hook]

[Engagement question]

P.S. [Subtle mention of ThingConnect solution or free tool]
```

**Example**:
```
üè≠ 67% of manufacturers experienced network-related downtime in Q4 2024.

During a recent plant visit, I saw a $50K monitoring tool miss the latency issues that shut down production for 3 hours. The problem? Generic IT tools don't understand manufacturing workflows.

Here's what manufacturing networks actually need:
‚Ä¢ Real-time performance monitoring (not just up/down status)
‚Ä¢ Production-aware alerting that understands shift schedules
‚Ä¢ Integration with quality and automation systems
‚Ä¢ Historical data for root cause analysis

What's your biggest network monitoring challenge in manufacturing?
