"I need to show our plant manager exactly where the network problem is affecting production," said Tom, the IT coordinator at a mid-size food processing facility. "Numbers and alerts are fine for troubleshooting, but management needs to see the big picture - which production lines are impacted when specific network components fail."

This request perfectly captures why network mapping is crucial in manufacturing environments. Unlike corporate IT networks where device relationships are mainly administrative, manufacturing networks have direct physical relationships to production processes. When the network switch serving Line 3 goes down, everyone needs to immediately understand which production equipment, quality stations, and operator interfaces are affected.

ThingConnect Pulse's network mapping capabilities transform abstract network monitoring data into visual representations that make sense to both IT teams and production personnel.

## Why Network Maps Matter in Manufacturing

### The Manufacturing Network Challenge:

Manufacturing networks are fundamentally different from corporate IT networks:

**Physical Production Relationships**:
- Network devices directly support specific production lines
- Device failures have immediate, measurable production impact
- Geographic layout matters - devices are physically distributed across the plant floor

**Multi-Stakeholder Requirements**:
- **IT Teams**: Need technical network topology for troubleshooting
- **Operations**: Need production-focused views showing line impacts
- **Management**: Need high-level overview of network health by area
- **Maintenance**: Need physical location context for repairs

**Time-Critical Decision Making**:
- Network issues require immediate assessment of production impact
- Maintenance teams need to quickly locate failed equipment
- Operations teams need to understand which processes to halt or continue

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Split view showing traditional network diagram vs production-focused network map -->

### Benefits of Visual Network Mapping:

**Faster Problem Resolution**:
- Immediate understanding of failure impact scope
- Visual identification of affected production areas
- Quick location of devices needing physical attention

**Better Communication**:
- Common visual language between IT and operations teams
- Clear representation of network dependencies
- Effective status communication to management

**Proactive Planning**:
- Visualization of network capacity and coverage
- Identification of single points of failure
- Strategic planning for network improvements

## Getting Started with Network Discovery

### Step 1: Configure Network Discovery

Before creating maps, ThingConnect Pulse needs to discover the devices on your manufacturing network:

```yaml
# config.yaml - Network discovery configuration
discovery:
  enabled: true
  
  # Define your manufacturing network subnets
  subnets:
    - name: "Production Line 1"
      network: "192.168.10.0/24"
      description: "Main assembly line network"
      
    - name: "Production Line 2"  
      network: "192.168.11.0/24"
      description: "Secondary assembly line network"
      
    - name: "Quality Systems"
      network: "192.168.20.0/24" 
      description: "Quality control and testing systems"
      
    - name: "Infrastructure"
      network: "192.168.1.0/24"
      description: "Core network infrastructure and servers"
      
  # Discovery settings
  scan_interval: "4h"           # Full network scan every 4 hours
  quick_scan_interval: "30m"    # Quick scan for changes every 30 minutes
  discovery_protocols:
    - "icmp"                    # Ping discovery
    - "snmp"                    # SNMP device identification
    - "tcp_ports"               # Common service port scanning
    
  # Manufacturing-specific device detection
  device_signatures:
    plc_modbus: 
      ports: [502]              # Modbus TCP
      timeout: "5s"
    plc_ethernet_ip:
      ports: [44818]            # Ethernet/IP
      timeout: "5s"  
    hmi_web:
      ports: [80, 8080, 443]    # Web-based HMIs
      timeout: "10s"
    opc_ua:
      ports: [4840]             # OPC UA servers
      timeout: "10s"
```

### Step 2: Run Initial Discovery

**Automatic Discovery Process**:
1. Open ThingConnect Pulse dashboard
2. Navigate to **Network → Discovery**  
3. Click **"Start Full Discovery"**
4. Monitor progress in real-time discovery log
5. Review discovered devices for accuracy

**Discovery Results Interpretation**:
```
Discovery Summary:
✓ 47 devices discovered across 4 subnets
✓ 12 PLCs identified (Modbus TCP responses)  
✓ 8 HMI stations found (HTTP services detected)
✓ 15 network infrastructure devices (SNMP capable)
✓ 12 unknown devices (respond to ping only)

Next Steps:
□ Categorize unknown devices
□ Add device descriptions and locations
□ Configure device groups by production area
□ Create initial network map layout
```

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Discovery results screen showing categorized devices with identification confidence scores -->

### Step 3: Device Categorization and Enrichment

**Assign Device Types**:
```yaml
# Device categorization after discovery
devices:
  # Production Line 1 devices
  - name: "PLC-Line1-Main"
    address: "192.168.10.10"
    type: "plc"
    manufacturer: "Allen-Bradley"
    model: "CompactLogix 5380"
    location: "Line 1 - Control Cabinet A"
    production_line: "Assembly Line 1"
    criticality: "critical"
    
  - name: "HMI-Line1-Station1"  
    address: "192.168.10.15"
    type: "hmi"
    manufacturer: "Rockwell"
    model: "PanelView Plus 7"
    location: "Line 1 - Operator Station 1"
    production_line: "Assembly Line 1"
    criticality: "high"
```

**Add Physical Location Context**:
```yaml
# Physical location mapping
locations:
  production_areas:
    line_1:
      name: "Assembly Line 1"
      description: "Primary production line - automotive parts"
      floor_plan_coordinates: {x: 100, y: 200}
      devices: ["PLC-Line1-Main", "HMI-Line1-Station1", "Scanner-Line1-A"]
      
    quality_lab:
      name: "Quality Control Lab"  
      description: "Inspection and testing area"
      floor_plan_coordinates: {x: 300, y: 150}
      devices: ["Quality-Server", "CMM-Station", "Vision-System-QC"]
```

## Creating Production-Focused Network Maps

### Map Layout Strategy:

**Geographic Layout** (Recommended for Manufacturing):
- Arrange devices based on physical plant layout
- Group devices by production line or functional area  
- Show physical cable runs and network infrastructure
- Align with actual floor plan and equipment locations

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Geographic network map overlay on plant floor plan -->

**Logical Hierarchy Layout**:
- Organize by network hierarchy (switches, routers, devices)
- Show VLAN boundaries and network segments
- Emphasize data flow and communication paths
- Useful for IT troubleshooting and network analysis

### Step 4: Configure Map Groups and Areas

```yaml
# Network map configuration
network_maps:
  production_overview:
    name: "Production Network Overview"
    description: "High-level view of all production systems"
    layout_type: "geographic"
    background_image: "floor-plans/plant-overview.png"
    
    # Define logical groups for the map
    device_groups:
      production_line_1:
        name: "Assembly Line 1"
        color: "#2E7D32"          # Green for normal operation
        position: {x: 150, y: 300}
        devices: 
          - "PLC-Line1-Main"
          - "HMI-Line1-Station1" 
          - "Scanner-Line1-A"
          - "Robot-Line1-Welding"
          
      production_line_2:
        name: "Assembly Line 2"  
        color: "#1976D2"          # Blue for secondary line
        position: {x: 150, y: 450}
        devices:
          - "PLC-Line2-Main"
          - "HMI-Line2-Station1"
          - "Conveyor-Line2-Controller"
          
      network_infrastructure:
        name: "Network Infrastructure"
        color: "#424242"          # Gray for infrastructure
        position: {x: 50, y: 100}
        devices:
          - "Core-Switch-Main"
          - "Distribution-Switch-Floor1"
          - "WAP-ProductionFloor-1"
```

## Best Practices for Manufacturing Network Maps

### Map Design Principles:

**Clarity and Simplicity**:
- Avoid visual clutter - show only relevant information for the audience
- Use consistent color schemes and iconography
- Group related devices logically
- Provide multiple detail levels (overview → detail drill-down)

**Production Relevance**:
- Organize maps around production processes, not just network topology
- Include production context (line names, process steps, shift information)  
- Show business impact alongside technical status
- Align with manufacturing team terminology and workflow

**Actionability**:
- Make it easy to identify what needs attention
- Provide clear visual hierarchy (critical → important → informational)
- Include enough context for decision-making
- Link to detailed troubleshooting information

### Map Maintenance and Updates:

**Regular Review Cycle**:
```yaml
# Map maintenance schedule
maintenance_schedule:
  weekly_review:
    - verify_device_locations_accurate
    - update_production_line_changes
    - review_map_performance_and_loading
    
  monthly_updates:
    - add_new_devices_and_equipment
    - remove_decommissioned_devices
    - update_physical_layout_changes
    - review_user_feedback_and_requests
    
  quarterly_assessment:
    - evaluate_map_effectiveness
    - plan_new_map_views_or_features  
    - update_integration_with_plant_systems
    - train_new_users_on_map_features
```

**Change Management**:
- Document all map changes with reasons and approvals
- Maintain backup copies of map configurations
- Test changes in non-production environment first
- Communicate map updates to all stakeholders

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Map change management workflow diagram -->

## Troubleshooting Map Issues

### Common Mapping Problems:

**Problem 1: Devices Not Appearing on Map**
- **Cause**: Device not discovered or discovery timeout
- **Solution**: Check device connectivity, extend discovery timeout, manually add device

**Problem 2: Incorrect Device Positioning**  
- **Cause**: Auto-layout algorithm conflicts with manual positioning
- **Solution**: Disable auto-layout for manually positioned devices, use constraints

**Problem 3: Map Performance Issues**
- **Cause**: Too many devices or complex animations
- **Solution**: Optimize device grouping, reduce animation complexity, implement map paging

**Problem 4: Background Image Alignment**
- **Cause**: Coordinate system mismatch between image and device positions
- **Solution**: Recalibrate coordinate mapping, use reference points for alignment

## Measuring Map Effectiveness

### Success Metrics:

**Usage Analytics**:
- Frequency of map access by different user roles
- Time spent on maps vs traditional device lists
- Click-through rates to device details from maps

**Problem Resolution Impact**:
- Reduction in time to identify problem location
- Improvement in first-time fix rates  
- Decrease in miscommunication between teams

**User Feedback**:
- User satisfaction with map clarity and usefulness
