Network downtime in manufacturing costs an average of $50,000 per hour. Yet 67% of manufacturing facilities can't identify network issues until production has already stopped. The difference between a proactive plant and a reactive one often comes down to having the right monitoring tools in place.

That's exactly why we built ThingConnect Pulse - a free, manufacturing-focused network monitoring solution that you can have running in your plant in less time than it takes to grab coffee.

## Why 5 Minutes Matters in Manufacturing

Unlike enterprise monitoring solutions that require weeks of deployment, complex licensing, and dedicated IT staff, ThingConnect Pulse was designed for the reality of manufacturing environments. Plant IT teams need solutions that work immediately, don't require extensive training, and can be deployed during brief maintenance windows.

## System Requirements

Before we dive into installation, let's ensure your system meets the minimal requirements:

### Minimum Requirements:
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for plants with 100+ devices)
- **Storage**: 2GB free disk space (scales with monitoring data retention)
- **Network**: Standard Ethernet connection to your plant network
- **Privileges**: Local administrator access for installation

### Recommended Environment:
- Dedicated monitoring PC or VM in your plant's IT infrastructure
- Network access to devices you want to monitor (ICMP, TCP, SNMP)
- Backup storage location for configuration files

## Step 1: Download ThingConnect Pulse (30 seconds)

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Screenshot of download page highlighting the Windows installer -->

### Quick Device Discovery:

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Screenshot of device discovery interface showing found devices -->

1. **Click "Discover Devices"** to automatically scan your network
2. **Review discovered devices** - typical manufacturing networks find:
   - PLCs and industrial controllers
   - Network switches and routers
   - HMI stations and operator interfaces
   - Printers and other networked equipment
3. **Select devices to monitor** (you can add more later)
4. **Click "Start Monitoring"**

## Step 4: Verification and First Look (30 seconds)

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Screenshot of the main dashboard showing live monitoring data -->

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Verify the dashboard loads** and shows your monitored devices
3. **Check device status** - devices should show green (online) or red (offline)
4. **Review the timeline** - you'll see monitoring data appear within minutes

**Success indicators**:
- All selected devices appear in the device list
- Status indicators are updating (watch for timestamp changes)
- No error messages in the system status area

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

### Issue: Installer Won't Run
**Symptoms**: "Access denied" or "Cannot execute" errors
**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're running as administrator
- Temporarily disable antivirus software
- Check Windows execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

### Issue: Service Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Dashboard shows "Service Unavailable"
**Solution**:
1. Open Services.msc
2. Find "ThingConnect Pulse Service"
3. Right-click → Properties → Startup Type → Automatic
4. Click Start

### Issue: No Devices Discovered
**Symptoms**: Network scan returns empty results
**Solution**:
- Verify network connectivity: `ping [device-ip]`
- Check firewall settings (ICMP must be allowed)
- Manually add devices using IP addresses

### Issue: Dashboard Not Accessible
**Symptoms**: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"
**Solution**:
- Verify Windows Firewall exceptions were created
- Try different port: Configuration → Dashboard → Port Settings
- Check if another application is using port 8080

## Post-Installation Best Practices

### Immediate Next Steps (First Hour):

1. **Configure Critical Alerts**:
   - Set up email notifications for production-critical devices
   - Define escalation rules for different device types
   - Test alert delivery to ensure notifications work

2. **Customize Dashboard Layout**:
   - Group devices by production line or area
   - Set up views for different team members (IT vs Operations)
   - Configure refresh rates appropriate for your environment

3. **Backup Configuration**:
   - Export your device configuration
   - Document any custom settings
   - Set up automated configuration backups

### First Week Optimization:

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Checklist graphic or infographic showing optimization tasks -->

- **Fine-tune polling intervals** based on device criticality
- **Set up historical data retention** policies
- **Create user accounts** for team members who need access

ThingConnect Pulse's 5-minute installation means you can:
- **Start monitoring immediately** during your lunch break
- **Prove value quickly** to stakeholders and management
- **Build confidence** in network monitoring before expanding scope
- **Respond faster** to network issues affecting production
