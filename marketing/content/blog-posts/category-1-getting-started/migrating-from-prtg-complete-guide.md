**PRTG SNMP Sensor Migration**:
```yaml
devices:
  - name: "Core-Switch-Main"
    address: "192.168.1.1"
    type: "switch"
    monitor_types: ["icmp", "snmp"]
    snmp:
      version: "2c" 
      community: "public"       # Use your actual community string
      port: 161
      timeout: "10s"
      custom_oids:
        # CPU utilization - commonly monitored in PRTG
        - name: "cpu_usage"
          oid: "1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.58.0"  # Cisco CPU OID
          warning_threshold: 70
          critical_threshold: 85
        # Memory utilization  
        - name: "memory_usage"
          oid: "1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.8.0"   # Cisco Memory OID
          warning_threshold: 80
          critical_threshold: 90
    check_interval: "2m"
```

### Priority 3: Application and Server Monitoring

**HTTP Sensor Migration**:
```yaml
devices:
  - name: "MES-Server"
    address: "192.168.1.100"
    type: "server"
    monitor_types: ["icmp", "http"]
    http:
      url: "https://192.168.1.100/health"
      method: "GET"
      expected_status: 200
      expected_content: "healthy"     # More flexible than PRTG
      headers:                        # Custom headers support
        Authorization: "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
      timeout: "30s"
    check_interval: "1m"
```

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Side-by-side configuration comparison showing PRTG sensor setup vs Pulse YAML -->

## Phase 3: Alert Rules and Notification Migration (1 hour)

PRTG's notification templates can be simplified and improved in ThingConnect Pulse.

### PRTG Notification Groups â†’ Pulse Alert Rules:

**PRTG Configuration**:
- Notification Group: "Production Team"
- Members: production@company.com, manager@company.com
- Trigger: Device Down, High CPU
- Schedule: 24/7

**ThingConnect Pulse Equivalent**:
```yaml
alerts:
  rules:
    - name: "Production Critical Alert"
      condition: "device_down"
      device_groups: ["production_critical"]
      severity: "critical"
      notification_methods: ["email"]
      recipients:
        - "production@company.com"
        - "manager@company.com"
      message: "ðŸš¨ Production Critical: {{device_name}} is {{condition}}"
      
    # Advanced: Production schedule awareness
    - name: "Production Hours Alert"  
      condition: "device_down OR high_cpu"
      device_groups: ["production_critical"]
      schedule:
        days: ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"]
        hours: "06:00-22:00"
      severity: "critical"
      escalation_delay: "5m"
```

### Improved Alert Features vs PRTG:

**Manufacturing Context**: Alerts understand production schedules and shift patterns
**Flexible Messaging**: Template variables and custom message formatting
**Smarter Escalation**: Time-based escalation without complex dependency rules
**Multi-Channel**: Email, SMS, webhook integration built-in

## Phase 4: Dashboard and Reporting Migration (30 minutes)

```yaml
reports:
  monthly_uptime:
    title: "Monthly Production System Uptime"
    schedule: "monthly"
    devices: ["production_critical"]
    metrics: ["uptime_percentage", "downtime_minutes", "alert_count"]
    recipients: ["management@company.com"]
    format: "pdf"
```

## Phase 5: Data Migration and Historical Preservation (Optional)

### PRTG Historical Data:

ThingConnect Pulse focuses on forward-looking monitoring rather than extensive historical data migration. However, you can preserve critical historical data:

**Export Key PRTG Data**:
1. Use PRTG's API to extract historical performance data
2. Export to CSV format for analysis
3. Import baseline performance metrics into Pulse configuration

**Baseline Configuration**:
```yaml
# Use historical PRTG data to set realistic thresholds
devices:
  - name: "PLC-Line-1"
    # ... other configuration
    thresholds:
      response_time:
        warning: 100ms      # Based on PRTG 95th percentile
        critical: 500ms     # Based on PRTG maximum observed
      availability:
        warning: 98%        # Based on historical uptime data
```

## Phase 6: Validation and Testing (1-2 hours)

### Parallel Operation Validation:

**Monitoring Coverage Checklist**:
```
âœ… All PRTG devices have Pulse equivalents
âœ… Critical alerts trigger in both systems  
âœ… Dashboard displays accurate status
âœ… Historical data collection is working
âœ… Team can access and understand new system
```

**Alert Testing Protocol**:
1. **Simulate device failure** (disconnect network cable)
2. **Verify both systems detect failure** within expected timeframes
3. **Compare alert messages** and notification timing
4. **Test escalation procedures** with actual team members
5. **Document any differences** in detection or notification

### Performance Comparison:

<!-- IMAGE NEEDED: Performance metrics comparison table -->
