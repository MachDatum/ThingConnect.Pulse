"Our SCADA system shows everything is connected, but production data is intermittently missing," said Jake, Controls Engineer at an automotive parts manufacturer. "We need to monitor the actual Modbus and OPC UA communications, not just whether devices respond to ping."

This scenario highlights a critical gap in traditional network monitoring: industrial networks rely on specialized protocols that carry production data, quality information, and control commands. Simple connectivity monitoring isn't enough - you need visibility into the actual industrial communication protocols that keep production running.

ThingConnect Pulse provides comprehensive monitoring for the industrial protocols that matter most in manufacturing environments, giving you insight into not just device connectivity, but communication quality and data integrity.

## Understanding Industrial Protocol Monitoring

### Why Industrial Protocols Need Special Monitoring:

**Protocol-Specific Health Indicators**:
- **Connection Status**: Basic TCP/IP connectivity
- **Protocol Health**: Successful protocol handshakes and data exchange
- **Data Quality**: Integrity and timing of industrial data transmission
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times specific to each protocol

**Manufacturing Impact Visibility**:
- Correlate protocol issues with production problems
- Identify intermittent communication problems that affect quality
- Monitor real-time control loop performance
- Track data historian and MES integration health

**Proactive Issue Detection**:
- Detect protocol degradation before it affects production
- Identify configuration mismatches and parameter drift
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities specific to industrial protocols
- Track communication patterns and usage trends
