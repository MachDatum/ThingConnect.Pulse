## Git Worktree Setup Commands

```bash
# From main repository
git worktree add ../pulse-env-setup feat/env-setup
git worktree add ../pulse-data-layer feat/data-layer
git worktree add ../pulse-monitoring feat/monitoring-core
git worktree add ../pulse-api feat/api-endpoints
git worktree add ../pulse-frontend feat/frontend-shell
git worktree add ../pulse-docs docs/specifications

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree when done
git worktree remove ../pulse-env-setup
```

## Merge Strategy

1. **Daily Integration**: Merge completed work to main daily
2. **Order of Merges**:
   - Environment setup first (blocks others)
   - Data layer (needed by APIs and monitoring)
   - API and Monitoring can merge independently
   - Frontend can merge anytime after API contracts
   - Documentation can merge anytime

## Success Metrics Per Phase

- **Phase 0**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Dev can run `dotnet build` successfully
- **Phase 1**: All specs frozen, no more contract changes
- **Phase 2**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Database created, migrations run, config storage & settings implemented with full testing
- **Phase 3**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Can detect UP/DOWN state changes with continuous monitoring, outage tracking, and concurrent probe execution
- **Phase 4**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - All 4 API endpoints implemented and tested: live status, history, config apply, and config versions.
- **Phase 5**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Issues #27, #28, and #29 complete: 15-minute and daily rollups computed automatically every 5 minutes with watermark tracking, plus configurable raw data pruning with 60-day default retention
- **Phase 6**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - UI loads, shows live status with real-time updates from backend, CORS integration working
- **Phase 7**: Service installs and runs
- **Phase 8**: All tests pass, code quality gates met

## Daily Standup Questions

1. Which worktree/issues did you complete?
2. Which worktree/issues are you working on today?
3. Any blockers or dependencies needed from other worktrees?
4. Ready to merge any branches to main?

## Risk Mitigation

- **Conflict Risk**: Keep worktrees focused on separate areas
- **Integration Risk**: Merge frequently (daily if possible)
- **Dependency Risk**: Complete Phase 0 & 1 before heavy parallel work
- **Quality Risk**: Each worktree must pass tests before merge

## Notes

- **SQLite Only**: PostgreSQL support structure ready but not implemented
- **ProgramData Path**: `C:\ProgramData\ThingConnect.Pulse\`
- **Testing**: NUnit for backend, React Testing Library for frontend
- **No Authentication**: v1 has no auth, localhost + LAN only
- **Manual Updates**: No auto-update, manual check only


# CLAUDE to Ignore this
Initial Work (Not Parallel - Must Do First)

Start TODAY with these in sequence:

1. ENV-03: Code Style & EditorConfig (3-4h)
- Create .editorconfig file
- Setup Directory.Build.props for the solution
- Configure nullable reference types
- This sets coding standards for everything that follows
2. ENV-09: Backend Dev Setup (1d)
- Configure SQLite connection string
- Setup appsettings.Development.json
- Configure ProgramData path for database
- Basic project structure
3. Issue #10: EF Core Entities & Migrations (1-2d)
- Implement the entities from /docs/data-model.cs
- Create PulseDbContext
- Add SQLite provider
- Generate initial migration
- This unlocks ALL backend work

Why These Can't Be Parallel Yet:

- ENV-03 must be done first because it sets code style rules that all other code must follow
- ENV-09 must be done before #10 because you need the project structure and connection strings
- Issue #10 (EF Core) blocks almost everything else:
- APIs need the database to query
- Monitoring needs tables to write to
- Rollups need data to process
- Config storage needs the ConfigVersion table

What Becomes Parallel After These 3:

Once you complete the above three issues, THEN you can split into parallel worktrees:

- Worktree 1: API endpoints (can use the EF context)
- Worktree 2: Monitoring core (can write to database)
- Worktree 3: Frontend (can start with mock data)
- Worktree 4: Documentation (always independent)
- Worktree 5: CI/CD setup (independent)

Recommended Approach for Today:

# Start with main branch for foundation work
git checkout -b feat/foundation

# Complete in this order:
1. ENV-03 (morning - 3-4 hours)
2. ENV-09 (afternoon - rest of day)
3. Issue #10 (tomorrow - full day)

# After these are merged to main, THEN create worktrees:
git worktree add ../pulse-api feat/api-endpoints
git worktree add ../pulse-monitoring feat/monitoring-core
git worktree add ../pulse-frontend feat/frontend-shell

Alternative: One Thing You CAN Do in Parallel Now:

If you want to parallelize immediately while working on the foundation:

Documentation Worktree - These have zero dependencies:
- SEC-01: Product Summary
- SEC-02: Problem & Value
- SEC-03: Target Users
- SEC-04: Scope & Non-Goals

# You could have someone work on docs while you do foundation
git worktree add ../pulse-docs docs/specifications

But for the core development work, you really need to complete ENV-03 â†’ ENV-09 â†’ #10 first to unlock everything else.
